# Weekly Seminars on <br/> Risk Management and Actuarial Science

<b>The weekly seminar series is a venue for international scholars in risk management and actuarial science to discuss research advances and exchange ideas. Junior researchers are the most encouraged to present their recent work, including on-going projects. The list of current and past speakers includes scholars from Canada, US, China, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, UK, Italy, Germany and France. </b>

* <b>To volunteer yourself or propose a speaker for a research presentation, please contact the organizers by email. </b>

* <b>We will send out weekly reminders via a mailing list, usually on the day before the presentation. Papers and presentation slides will be circulated among participants via the mailing list. If you would like to be included in the list, please contact the organizers.</b>

* <b>In this year of 2023, most seminars are held in person at the University of Waterloo.

            <p><b> Title: Generalization and Regularization via Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization </b></p>
            <p><b> Speaker: Qinyu Wu (Postdoc Fellow, University of Waterloo) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time: 15:30 - 17:00 pm, Apr 14 (Thu) </b></p>
            <p><b> Location: M3 4206 </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has found success in operations research and machine learning applications as a powerful means to obtain solutions with favorable out-of-sample performances. Two compelling explanations for the success are the generalization bounds derived from Wasserstein DRO and the equivalency between Wasserstein DRO and the regularization scheme commonly applied in machine learning. Existing results on generalization bounds and the equivalency to regularization are largely limited to the setting where the Wasserstein ball is of a certain type and the decision criterion takes certain forms of an expected function. In this paper, we show that by focusing on Wasserstein DRO problems with affine decision rules, it is possible to obtain generalization bounds and the equivalency to regularization in a significantly broader setting where the Wasserstein ball can be of a general type and the decision criterion can be a general measure of risk, i.e., nonlinear in distributions. This allows for accommodating many important classification, regression, and risk minimization applications that have not been addressed to date using Wasserstein DRO. Our results are strong in that the generalization bounds do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the equivalency to regularization is exact. As a byproduct, our regularization results broaden considerably the class of Wasserstein DRO models that can be solved efficiently via regularization formulations.. </b></p>

            <p><b> Title: Risk sharing, measuring variability, and distortion riskmetrics </b></p>
            <p><b> Speaker: Jean-Gabriel Lauzier (Postdoc Fellow, University of Waterloo) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time: 15:30 - 17:00 pm, Apr 6 (Thu) </b></p>
            <p><b> Location: M3 4206 </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: We address the problem of sharing risk among agents with preferences modelled by a general class of comonotonic additive and law-based functionals that need not be either monotone or convex. Such functionals are called distortion riskmetrics, which include many statistical measures of risk and variability used in portfolio optimization and insurance. The set of Pareto-optimal allocations is characterized under various settings of general or comonotonic risk sharing problems. We solve explicitly Pareto-optimal allocations among agents using the Gini deviation, the mean-median deviation, or the inter-quantile difference as the relevant variability measures. The latter is of particular interest, as optimal allocations are not comonotonic in the presence of inter-quantile difference agents; instead, the optimal allocation features a mixture of pairwise counter-monotonic structures, showing some patterns of extremal negative dependence. </b></p>

            <p><b> Title: Conditional and Dynamic Convex Risk Measures </b></p>
            <p><b> Speaker: Zachary John Van Oosten (University of Waterloo) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time: 15:30 - 17:00 pm, Mar 30 (Thu) </b></p>
            <p><b> Location: M3 4206 </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: The paper extends the definition of convex risk measures to the conditional setting. The framework can be seen as a generalization of classical risk measures.  Much like the non-conditional case, the notion of acceptable sets is introduced and the interplay between such sets and measures is discussed.  A representation result is proved in terms of conditional expectation. Afterward, a regularity property is defined and conditional convex risk measures are shown to have it. The paper finishes by defining dynamic convex risk measures and characterizes those satisfying some natural time consistency properties.    </b></p>

            <p><b> Location: M3 3127 </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: This paper extends the results of Jewell (1974) of forecasting the distribution of individual risk in cases where the observations are weighted or are grouped in intervals. The credibility estimation is obtained by restricting the class of admissible functions, leading to the so-called linearized credibility results and the optimal projection theorem is also applied for credibility estimation. In addition, distribution credibility estimators are also established, and numerical illustrations are herein presented. Two examples of distribution credibility estimation are given, one with insurance loss data and the other with industry financial data.   </b></p>

            <p><b> Speaker: Qinghua Ren (PhD Student, University of Waterloo) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time: 15:30 - 17:00 pm, Mar 16 (Thu) </b></p>
            <p><b> Location: M3 3127 </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: This paper introduced the model uncertainty into the classic reinsurance framework and focused on distributionally robust reinsurance problems by minimizing the worst-case VaR(CVaR) of the total retained loss. The authors obtained closed-form solutions for the worst-case VaR over an uncertainty set containing distributions with common ﬁrst two moments. The optimal deductibles of the optimization problems were also obtained. The paper showed that the worst-case CVaR is equal to the worst-case VaR of the insurer’s total retained loss under stop-loss reinsurance contract. Several numerical experiments were conducted to compare this model with classic stop-loss reinsurance framework.   </b></p>

            <p><b> Speaker: Ziyue Shi (PhD Student, University of Waterloo) </b></p>

            <p><b> Location: M3 4206 </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: This talk is based on the work of Chen et al. (2016), which studies an optimal retrospective rating plan by minimizing the risk exposure of the insured under the framework of convex order. This paper adopts a little-studied premium principle called the retrospective rating plan premium. This premium principle considers the insured's actual losses during the policy year and, in fact, it is widely used in insurance practice. In this talk, we will introduce the retrospective rating plan premium, elaborate on the model setup, and discuss the main results of the background paper.   </b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: Restricting the variance of a policy's return is a popular choice in risk-averse reinforcement learning (RL) literature due to its clear mathematical definition and easy interpretability. In this presentation, the fundamental concepts of traditional risk-neutral RL are first introduced, followed with the risk-averse mean-variance RL problem. The existing mean-variance RL methods are described, and their limitations are discussed.  </b></p>
