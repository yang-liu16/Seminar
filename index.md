# Weekly Seminars on <br/> Risk Management and Actuarial Science

<b>The weekly seminar series is a venue for international scholars in risk management and actuarial science to discuss research advances and exchange ideas. Junior researchers are the most encouraged to present their recent work, including on-going projects. The list of current and past speakers includes scholars from Canada, US, China, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, UK, Italy, Germany and France. </b>

* <b>To volunteer yourself or propose a speaker for a research presentation, please contact the organizers by email. </b>

* <b>We will send out weekly reminders via a mailing list, usually on the day before the presentation. Papers and presentation slides will be circulated among participants via the mailing list. If you would like to be included in the list, please contact the organizers.</b>

* <b>In this year of 2023, most seminars are held in person at the University of Waterloo.

            <p><b> Title: The design of an optimal retrospective rating plan </b></p>
            <p><b> Speaker: Ziyue Shi (PhD Student, University of Waterloo) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time: 15:30 - 17:00 pm, Mar 9 (Thu) </b></p>
            <p><b> Location: M3 4206 </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: This talk is based on the work of Chen et al. (2016), which studies an optimal retrospective rating plan by minimizing the risk exposure of the insured under the framework of convex order. This paper adopts a little-studied premium principle called the retrospective rating plan premium. This premium principle considers the insured's actual losses during the policy year and, in fact, it is widely used in insurance practice. In this talk, we will introduce the retrospective rating plan premium, elaborate on the model setup, and discuss the main results of the background paper.   </b></p>

            <p><b> Title: Mean-Variance Reinforcement Learning </b></p>
            <p><b> Speaker: <a href = "http://miyunluo.com/"> Yudong Luo </a> (PhD Candidate, University of Waterloo & Vector Institute) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time: 15:30 - 17:00 pm, Mar 2 (Thu) </b></p>
            <p><b> Location: M3 4206 </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: Restricting the variance of a policy's return is a popular choice in risk-averse reinforcement learning (RL) literature due to its clear mathematical definition and easy interpretability. In this presentation, the fundamental concepts of traditional risk-neutral RL are first introduced, followed with the risk-averse mean-variance RL problem. The existing mean-variance RL methods are described, and their limitations are discussed.  </b></p>
