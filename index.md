# Weekly Seminars on <br/> Risk Management and Actuarial Science

<b>The weekly seminar series is a venue for international scholars in risk management and actuarial science to discuss research advances and exchange ideas. Junior researchers are the most encouraged to present their recent work, including on-going projects. The list of current and past speakers includes scholars from Canada, US, China, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, UK, Italy, Germany and France. </b>

* <b>To volunteer yourself or propose a speaker for a research presentation, please contact the organizers by email. </b>

* <b>We will send out weekly reminders via a mailing list, usually on the day before the presentation. Papers and presentation slides will be circulated among participants via the mailing list. If you would like to be included in the list, please contact the organizers.</b>

* <b>In this year of 2023, most seminars are held in person at the University of Waterloo.

            <p><b> Title: Weighted Credibility Distribution Estimation with Applications to Insurance and Finance </b></p>
            <p><b> Speaker: <a href = "https://www.unipi.gr/unipi/en/pitselis.html"> Georgios Pitselis </a> (Assistant Professor, University of Piraeus) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time: 15:30 - 17:00 pm, Mar 23 (Thu) </b></p>
            <p><b> Location: M3 3127 </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: This paper extends the results of Jewell (1974) of forecasting the distribution of individual risk in cases where the observations are weighted or are grouped in intervals. The credibility estimation is obtained by restricting the class of admissible functions, leading to the so-called linearized credibility results and the optimal projection theorem is also applied for credibility estimation. In addition, distribution credibility estimators are also established, and numerical illustrations are herein presented. Two examples of distribution credibility estimation are given, one with insurance loss data and the other with industry financial data.   </b></p>

            <p><b> Title: Distributionally robust reinsurance with Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at-Risk </b></p>
            <p><b> Speaker: Qinghua Ren (PhD Student, University of Waterloo) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time: 15:30 - 17:00 pm, Mar 16 (Thu) </b></p>
            <p><b> Location: M3 3127 </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: This paper introduced the model uncertainty into the classic reinsurance framework and focused on distributionally robust reinsurance problems by minimizing the worst-case VaR(CVaR) of the total retained loss. The authors obtained closed-form solutions for the worst-case VaR over an uncertainty set containing distributions with common ﬁrst two moments. The optimal deductibles of the optimization problems were also obtained. The paper showed that the worst-case CVaR is equal to the worst-case VaR of the insurer’s total retained loss under stop-loss reinsurance contract. Several numerical experiments were conducted to compare this model with classic stop-loss reinsurance framework.   </b></p>

            <p><b> Title: The design of an optimal retrospective rating plan </b></p>
            <p><b> Speaker: Ziyue Shi (PhD Student, University of Waterloo) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time: 15:30 - 17:00 pm, Mar 9 (Thu) </b></p>
            <p><b> Location: M3 4206 </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: This talk is based on the work of Chen et al. (2016), which studies an optimal retrospective rating plan by minimizing the risk exposure of the insured under the framework of convex order. This paper adopts a little-studied premium principle called the retrospective rating plan premium. This premium principle considers the insured's actual losses during the policy year and, in fact, it is widely used in insurance practice. In this talk, we will introduce the retrospective rating plan premium, elaborate on the model setup, and discuss the main results of the background paper.   </b></p>

            <p><b> Title: Mean-Variance Reinforcement Learning </b></p>
            <p><b> Speaker: <a href = "http://miyunluo.com/"> Yudong Luo </a> (PhD Candidate, University of Waterloo & Vector Institute) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time: 15:30 - 17:00 pm, Mar 2 (Thu) </b></p>
            <p><b> Location: M3 4206 </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract: Restricting the variance of a policy's return is a popular choice in risk-averse reinforcement learning (RL) literature due to its clear mathematical definition and easy interpretability. In this presentation, the fundamental concepts of traditional risk-neutral RL are first introduced, followed with the risk-averse mean-variance RL problem. The existing mean-variance RL methods are described, and their limitations are discussed.  </b></p>
