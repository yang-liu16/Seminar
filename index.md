# Weekly Seminars on <br/> Risk Management and Actuarial Science

<b>The weekly seminar series is a venue for international scholars in risk management and actuarial science to discuss research advances and exchange ideas. Junior researchers are the most encouraged to present their recent work, including on-going projects. The list of current and past speakers includes scholars from Canada, US, China, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, UK, Italy, Germany and France. </b>

* <b>To volunteer yourself or propose a speaker for a research presentation, please contact the organizers by email. </b>

* <b>We will send out weekly reminders via a mailing list, usually on the day before the presentation. Papers and presentation slides will be circulated among participants via the mailing list. If you would like to be included in the list, please contact the organizers.</b>

            <p><b> Speaker: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/pengliushomepage/home">Peng Liu</a> (Lecturer/Assistant Professor, University of Essex) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time: 9:00am-10:00am ET, Apr 7 (Thu) </b></p>
            <p><b> Location: Online via Zoom </b></p>
            <p><b> Abstract:  We offer a minimalist axiomatization of quantiles among all real-valued mappings on a general set of distributions through only one axiom. This axiom is called ordinality:  quantiles are the only mappings that commute with all increasing and continuous transforms. Other convenient properties of quantiles, monotonicity, semicontinuity, comonotonic additivity and elicitability in particular,  follow from this axiom. Furthermore, on the set of convexly supported distributions, the median is the only mapping that commutates with all monotone and continuous transforms. On a general set of distributions,  the median interval is pinned down as the unique minimal interval-valued mapping that commutes with all monotone and continuous transforms. Finally, our main result, put in a decision-theoretic setting, leads to a minimalist axiomatization of quantile preferences. In banking and insurance, quantiles are known as the standard regulatory risk measure Value-at-Risk (VaR), and thus, an axiomatization of VaR is obtained with only one axiom among law-based risk measures. </b></p>
